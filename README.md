# Deep Learning Based Landmark Detection on Spine Images
### _Challenges with Image Preparation and Reproduction of Published Results_

--- 

Detection of vertebral landmarks on spine images is a useful step in processing of spine X-ray towards the creation of patient-specific digital twins, which may be used pre-operatively for 3D visualization, or to simulate relevant biophysical scenarios (for treatment planning). Deep learning approaches are the state-of-the-art techniques nowadays for landmark detection.
